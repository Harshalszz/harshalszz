## 🧩 Professional Experience  

### Associate Engineer (RuPay International Team)	- National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)  Mumbai, India 
- Contributed to the development and enhancement of core RuPay payment platforms NTS (Network Tokenization 
System) and SecureNXT, supporting high-volume, mission-critical card payment transactions. 
- Led the design and implementation of a secure “Key Rotation” feature for NTS: 
- Built a maker-checker workflow in the React.js-based NTS Admin Portal for controlled RSA key lifecycle management. 
- Developed backend logic in Spring Boot (Java) for RSA key pair generation, secure database updates, staged table 
management, and rollback capability. 
- Automated proactive key renewal (1 month prior to expiry) with backup retention of previous keys to ensure zero 
downtime and high operational resilience. 
- Enhanced the NTS Admin Portal (React.js + Spring Boot) by implementing new features, resolving end-to-end 
production defects, and improving usability and operational efficiency. 
- Engineered enhancements to token lifecycle management: 
- Resolved critical production issues related to token generation against card PAN (debit/credit). 
- Implemented real-time notification mechanisms triggered on card PAN/expiry updates. 
- Integrated Apache Kafka–based event streaming to notify Token Requestors and Issuers (via ISO/API formats), 
ensuring data synchronization and regulatory compliance. 
- Designed and developed a secure dynamic reporting engine using JWT + AES-based authentication, integrated Log4j 
audit logging, and built customizable dashboards for RuPay card offer management. 
- Debugged and optimized high-throughput payment services built on Vert.x and Spring Framework, improving 
performance, stability, and response time under peak transaction loads. 
- Designed and configured high-availability distributed infrastructure: Redis Cluster for caching and session resilience, 
Kafka + Zookeeper for event-driven communication, MySQL replication for database fault tolerance 
- Built and maintained Jenkins CI/CD pipelines enabling automated builds, testing, and deployments across UAT and 
Production environments, reducing manual deployment effort and release risk. 
- Managed and supported UAT and Production environments on Ubuntu servers, including deployment, configuration, 
monitoring, release validation, and client issue resolution. 
- Actively participated in UAT testing, production release validation, and L2/L3 support, performing root cause 
analysis and rapid resolution of high-priority payment incidents. 
- Worked with EMVCo 3DS specifications and RuPay payment processing standards, ensuring compliance with global 
security and authentication protocols. 
- Used Jira for sprint planning, defect tracking, and cross-functional coordination in Agile development environments.
